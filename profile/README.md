## RESEARCH
Membrane Organization of Cells and Tissues
Biological membranes are fascinating composites of lipids, proteins and sugars. Our aim is to understand how the molecular components self-organize into meso-scale complexes that control processes as adhesion, polarization, signaling/sensing, which underlie morphogenesis of cells and tissues.

To this end, we pursue a mutli-scale approach:

####  (1) Supra-Molecular-Organization of Membrane Complexes in Cells and Tissues 
    We use and develop super-resolution STED microscopy in combination with 3D tissue culture to study how molecules organize into functional meso-scale structures. Currently we are working on the Apical Junction Complex. 

#### (2) Reconstitution of Membrane Complexes by Molecular Self-Organization in vitro 
  We purify key organizing proteins to re-assemble complex structures and functions in controlled in vitro membrane systems. We are particularly interested in collective processes such as phase transitions / separation and active feedback systems.

#### (3) Control of Morphogenesis in Epithelial Organoids
  We aim to apply and test the molecular and mesoscale self-organization principles during the morphogenesis of stem cell derived organoids. We especially focus on the interplay of cell adhesion, cortical mechanics and cell differentiation.
